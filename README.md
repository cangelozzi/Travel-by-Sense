# Travel-by-Sense

INTRODUCTION
The idea behind the "Travel by Sense" Web Application came from the need to link the five major Human Senses 
(Hearing, Vision, Touch, Smell and Audition) with the "activity" of traveling.  

The User would select a "location" to discover and based on that location, he/she would choose a Sense related to that place:
- to please the "Vision" sense, the user will be prompted with pictures, corners and outdoors related to the place.
- for the "Audition" part, a list of sounds, concerts, artists and album somehow linked to the city will be shown.
- for the "Touch" a list of handcrafts/handmade items will be discovered and ready to be purchased online.
- about the "Touch/Smell" senses a list of venues such as bars, restaurants, caf√©s and pubs will be ready available to the user.

TECHNOLOGY & DESIGN
The coding part is basically done around HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery, with the use of several API (GoogleMaps, Foursquare, LastFm 
and Etsy).  The UI / UX was developed behind a realy simple and clean interface, trying to avoid many "clicks" leaving the user
the opportunity to concentrate on the content and use of the app itself.

First challenge and need was to give a guide to the user already when selecting the location; for this reason an 
"AutoComplete Place API" from Google Map was used, helping to complete the search and making a more specific result based on 
a real geo-lcation (city + country).

The second part of the app is related to the "sense choice" that the user would make about that location, with the ability
to choose a "sense to discover" related to the choosen location.  For this part, various API were involved, returning the results 
and giving the opportunity to link directly to the site itself for further details.

During the implementation phase and going back to the original idea of a clean and simple interface, in each result page
the user will have the opportunity to go back to the "Senses" list to select a different search on the same location.  
On the other hand, the user can easily go back to the main search page in case of selecting a different location.

CONCLUSION
Of course, the application has main improvement area, more and different API can be uses and added; a valuable point related to
"Travel by Sense" is the opportunity to attract a different numbers of user with different needs, different interests..
or just user who are courious about a particular location.  The blogger may find a good place to search for new venues in the city;
the musician can be attracted to past concerts, a particular local artist;  a photo-fanatic can search for the next place where
to shoot some pictures;  the users looking for local handcrafts can discover and research the next item to add to their 
collection.
